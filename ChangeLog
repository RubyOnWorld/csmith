Changes since 2.0.0 release:

	Renamed environment variable `CSMITH_PATH' to be `CSMITH_HOME'.
	`HOME' is the common naming convention for variables that identify
	a single directory; `PATH' is the convention for lists of
	directories.
	
	By default, mark variables and functions as "static" since some
	compilers can exploit this to optimize more aggressively.

	Loop code generation is significantly generalized [Xuejun: please
	give some details].

	Several bugs were fixed.
