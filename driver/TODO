make a centralized file for config information

make log format saner

pluggable scripts for 
  running compilers
  evaluating programs
  uniquifying crash strings

when a new bug is found
  if known to be duplicate, drop it
  otherwise, reduce and version search

daily or so
  update and rebuild the compiler under test
  check all known test cases including fixed ones
  prioritize the broken ones and report them
  high priority
    seems new, for wrong-code bugs
    has a different string, for crash bugs
  report on progress to web, email, RSS feed
  if compiler can't be built, report this and sleep for a day

relevance estimation: does fault localization place the bug in 
  a part of the code that gets executed by our test suite?

make a VM image for the cloud, or a local machine
